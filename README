Functionality
--------

Initially the library has been implemented to support making requests to the API only.
It is intended that with time and collaboration that response types and parsing will
soon be added.

At present the library offers the following funcitonality...
* Ability to build search requests using Objective-C object types
* An OO representation of a Google Places search request (PlacesRequest.m)
* Ability to build a Google Places URL request string from a PlacesRequest object
* Pre-defined constants for all supported places types
* Pre-defined constants for all supported languages

Installation
============

The easiest way to get going is to simply copy the library files into your existing
XCode project (don't bother with the tests).

Alternatively the library also builds as a static library and can be linked against.
